  <h2 class="intro_qs">Here is some info to get to know me better.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="intro_qs"> <strong>Personal Background:</strong></li>  <li class="indented">I was born and raised in Europe, in a small country of Belarus. I moved to the USA 10 years go and I have lived in Virginia, Florida and North Carolina. Married and then divorced, now I am a single mom of an 8 years old daughter, but I like it this way.</li> 

	<li class="intro_qs"><strong>Professional Background: </strong></li> <li class="indented">I've had different jobs in retail and customer service field that are not really worth mentioning. I currently work at a bank and I am training to become a loan officer, which is not quite what I want but it gives me more room for growth and opportunities in the future.</li> 
	<li class="intro_qs"> <strong> Academic Background: </strong></li> <li class="indented">I graduated from a Pedagogical Gymnasium (a fancy name for a school with a different curriculum in Europe) back in Belarus. I then enrolled into State Linguistic University, where I studied for four years but was unable to graduate due to moving to the States. My major was French Language with a sub-major in Computer Linguistics. I used to be passionate about languages and used to speak 6 languages. This all vanished when I moved and started only speaking English. I am currently working towards an Associate's degree in Software Development though I am becoming interested in Cyber Security. </li> 
	<li class="intro_qs"> <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong></li> <li class="indented"> Windows </li> 
	<li class="intro_qs"> <strong>Courses I'm Taking, & Why: </strong></li> <li class="indented">
<li class="indented"><b>WEB110:</b> I am only taking WEB110 this semester. Initially I wasn't planning on taking any summer classes, but I also have not made any vacation plans, so I figured I could manage one class. I thought I was choosing an easy one. Boy, was I wrong... But I don't want to work in a financial field for the next 10 years, so I am going to push through and work hard so I can transition to a new career path. &nbsp; <a id="local_link" href="contract.html" class="external_links"><strong>Course Contract</strong></a></li> 
<li class="intro_qs"> <strong>I'd Also Like to Share:</strong></li> <li class="indented"> I used to play with html codes when I was 15 or so. Even though I had no idea what I was doing most of the time and looking back my codes were very messy, it makes it a little bit easier for me now. I'd be lost...</li>
