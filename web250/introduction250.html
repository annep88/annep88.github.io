  <ul>
    	<li><b>Personal Background</b>: I was born and raised in Belarus and moved to the US 13 years ago. I lived in Virginia and Florida for a few years and moved to the Charlotte area in 2016.</li>
	<li><b>Professional Background</b>: For the past 5 years I’ve worked at a local Credit Union, first as a teller, now as a loan officer. I do not have any technical professional background but I am hoping to change this soon.</li> 
	<li><b>Academic Background</b>: Back in Belarus I went to Linguistic University with my major being French Language and minor in Computer Linguistics. We learned about Conversational AI but more so from the linguistic standpoint, so the technical side of it was not covered. I did not finish University as I moved to the US. Life got in the way and it took me almost 10 years to go back to college. At this point I decided to take a completely different route and I am now a student at CPCC studying Software Development.</li> 
	<li><b>Primary Computer Platform</b>: Windows 10</li> 
	<li><b>Courses I'm Taking, & Why</b>:

	<li class="main_text"><strong>CSC250:</strong> Data Structures & Algorithms –   This is the last class I need to take in order to graduate.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>I'd Also Like to Share</b>: I love cross stitching but can never seem to find time to do it.</li>
