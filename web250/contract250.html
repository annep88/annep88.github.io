<h3>Course Contract</h3>
            I, <a href= "introduction250.html" class="links"> Anna V. Winter</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my WEB250-N801: Database Driven Websites with my instructor, 
		D.I. von Briesen.<p>

	I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, 
	and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<p>

	I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. <p>

Signed, <a href= "introduction250.html" class="links"> Anna Viacheslavovna Winter</a>, January 25, 2023. <br> <br>
